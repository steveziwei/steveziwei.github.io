<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, mask wearing has become a global phenomenon. How do masks influence wearers’ behavior in everyday life? We examine the effect of masks on wearers’ deviant behavior in China, where mask wearing is mostly a publichealth issue rather than a political issue. Drawing on behavioral ethics research, we test two competing hypotheses: (a) masks disinhibit wearers’ deviant behavior by increasing their sense of anonymity and (b) masks are a moral symbol that reduces wearers’ deviant behavior by heightening their moral awareness. The latter hypothesis was consistently supported by 10 studies (including direct replications) using mixed methods (e.g., traffic camera recording analysis, observational field studies, experiments, and natural field experiment) and different measures of deviant behavior (e.g., running a red light, bike parking in no-parking zones, cheating for money, and deviant behavior in the library). Our research (n = 68,243) is among the first to uncover the psychological and behavioral consequences of mask wearing beyond its health benefits.</p>

Cheng, X., Huang, R.*, Yin, C., & <b>Song, S. Z.</b> Data War: The Value of Personal Data Protection in Cost Management</a></strong>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Using the enactment of the Cybersecurity Law (CSL) in China as an exogenous shock, this paper examines the effect of the prohibition of unauthorized data poaching on firms’ cost behaviors. We document that, in face of less data competition after the implementation of CSL, affected firms spend less to fend off potential customer stealing through data poaching, resulting in lower levels of cost stickiness. This effect is stronger for firms that face stronger market competition and rely more on individual customers. Results are robust to parallel trend analyses, placebo tests, PSM matched samples and alternative treatment identifications. In additional analyses, we find that affected firms tend to cut slack SG&A instead of COGS spending, and by doing so achieve better social performance. Overall, this study suggests that the CSL can save firms from wasted spending in underground data competition and encourage firms to pump money into pursuing stakeholders’ benefits instead.</p>

<b>Song, S. Z.</b>, Tian, G. G., Wang, L.*, & Zheng, D. Executive Pay Restrictions, Political Promotion Incentives, and R&D Investments</a></strong>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Exploiting the 2014 pay restriction scheme for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China as a natural experiment, this study finds a significant decrease in the research and development (R&D) investment of SOEs compared with non-SOEs after implementation of the scheme. The study further documents that the effect of the pay restriction scheme is attenuated in SOEs that have higher political ranks or offer more opportunities for political promotion. Finally, the study shows that SOEs experience a decrease in executive pay–performance sensitivity (PPS), innovation quality, and firm value after the pay restriction. Overall, our findings suggest that restricting executive pay impedes corporate R&D investment by distorting incentives from compensation; however, political promotion incentive mitigates the negative impact of the SOE pay restriction scheme.</p>

<b>宋子威</b>, 郑登津*. 技术创新激励政策下的研发管理与费用分类调整行为</a></strong>, 《经济学（季刊）》第二轮审稿
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>技术创新激励政策旨在鼓励企业创新，在实践中可能存在诱发企业为寻求政策优惠而策略性调整费用分类的行为，但相关的学术研究较少。本文发现企业会通过调整管理费用分类以增加研发费用，且主要通过调整管理费用中的员工薪酬和折旧摊销项目实现。进一步，本文发现费用分类调整的行为在非国有企业和具有盈余压力的企业中更加明显，但面临着审计和税收征管的内外部监督；对研发费用进行正确归属和列报有助于抑制费用分类调整行为。此外，销售费用和生产成本也会被分类调整以增加研发费用。最后，存在费用分类调整行为的企业虽然获取了税收优惠和政府补贴，但其研发绩效显著更低。</p>
