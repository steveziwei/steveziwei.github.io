<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, mask wearing has become a global phenomenon. How do masks influence wearers’ behavior in everyday life? We examine the effect of masks on wearers’ deviant behavior in China, where mask wearing is mostly a publichealth issue rather than a political issue. Drawing on behavioral ethics research, we test two competing hypotheses: (a) masks disinhibit wearers’ deviant behavior by increasing their sense of anonymity and (b) masks are a moral symbol that reduces wearers’ deviant behavior by heightening their moral awareness. The latter hypothesis was consistently supported by 10 studies (including direct replications) using mixed methods (e.g., traffic camera recording analysis, observational field studies, experiments, and natural field experiment) and different measures of deviant behavior (e.g., running a red light, bike parking in no-parking zones, cheating for money, and deviant behavior in the library). Our research (n = 68,243) is among the first to uncover the psychological and behavioral consequences of mask wearing beyond its health benefits.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Using the enactment of the Cybersecurity Law (CSL) in China as an exogenous shock, this paper examines the effect of the prohibition of unauthorized data poaching on firms’ cost behaviors. We document that, in face of less data competition after the implementation of CSL, affected firms spend less to fend off potential customer stealing through data poaching, resulting in lower levels of cost stickiness. This effect is stronger for firms that face stronger market competition and rely more on individual customers. Results are robust to parallel trend analyses, placebo tests, PSM matched samples and alternative treatment identifications. In additional analyses, we find that affected firms tend to cut slack SG&A instead of COGS spending, and by doing so achieve better social performance. Overall, this study suggests that the CSL can save firms from wasted spending in underground data competition and encourage firms to pump money into pursuing stakeholders’ benefits instead.</p>
